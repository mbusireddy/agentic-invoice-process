# üß™ Invoice Processing System - Complete Testing Guide

This guide covers comprehensive testing of all system functionality including the new secure authentication system.

## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

### 1. Start the System
```bash
# Option A: Development mode
./scripts/start_services.sh

# Option B: Direct Streamlit launch
python main.py web

# Option C: CLI mode
python main.py process --help
```

### 2. Access the Web Interface
- Open browser to: http://localhost:8501
- You should see the secure login screen

## üîê Authentication Testing

### Default Credentials
```
Username: admin
Password: Admin123!
```

### Test Cases to Execute

#### 1. Login Functionality
- [ ] **Valid Login**: Use admin/Admin123! - should succeed
- [ ] **Invalid Password**: Try admin/wrongpass - should fail with error
- [ ] **Invalid Username**: Try baduser/Admin123! - should fail
- [ ] **Empty Fields**: Leave fields blank - should show validation error
- [ ] **Account Lockout**: Try 5+ wrong passwords - account should lock for 15 minutes

#### 2. Password Security
- [ ] **Weak Password**: Try changing to "123" - should reject
- [ ] **Strong Password**: Change to "NewPass123!" - should succeed
- [ ] **Password Confirmation**: Mismatched confirm password - should fail
- [ ] **Current Password**: Wrong current password - should fail

#### 3. Session Management
- [ ] **Session Persistence**: Login, close browser, reopen - should stay logged in
- [ ] **Logout**: Click logout button - should return to login screen
- [ ] **Session Timeout**: Wait 2+ hours idle - should auto-logout
- [ ] **Multiple Sessions**: Login from different browsers - both should work

## üë• User Management Testing (Admin Only)

### Create Test Users
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Administration ‚Üí Create User tab
3. Create users with different roles:

```
Username: processor1
Password: Process123!
Role: Processor
Email: processor@test.com

Username: viewer1  
Password: View123!
Role: Viewer
Email: viewer@test.com

Username: auditor1
Password: Audit123!
Role: Auditor  
Email: auditor@test.com
```

### Test Role-Based Access Control
- [ ] **Processor Role**: Can access Process Invoices, Dashboard, History
- [ ] **Viewer Role**: Can only access Dashboard, History (read-only)
- [ ] **Auditor Role**: Can access View, Audit, Reports
- [ ] **Admin Role**: Can access everything including Administration
- [ ] **Permission Denied**: Lower roles accessing admin features should be blocked

## üìä Core System Testing

### 1. System Health Check
```bash
# Test CLI health check
python main.py health

# Expected output:
# - All 6 agents initialized
# - System status: healthy
# - Ollama connection status
```

### 2. Invoice Processing (Web Interface)

#### Test Files Setup
Create test files in `data/invoices/`:
```bash
# Create sample test files
echo "Sample Invoice Content" > data/invoices/test1.txt
echo "Another Invoice Sample" > data/invoices/test2.txt
```

#### Processing Tests
- [ ] **File Upload**: Drag & drop files - should show upload success
- [ ] **Workflow Selection**: Try different workflows (Standard, Fast Track, etc.)
- [ ] **Single Processing**: Process one file - should show progress bar
- [ ] **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files - should handle all files
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Upload invalid file - should show appropriate error
- [ ] **Results Display**: Processing should show confidence scores and status

### 3. Dashboard Testing
- [ ] **System Metrics**: Should show agent health, processing stats
- [ ] **Performance Charts**: Should display processing times and success rates
- [ ] **Recent Activity**: Should show latest processing results
- [ ] **Resource Usage**: Should display system resource information

### 4. History & Audit Testing
- [ ] **Processing History**: Should show previous processing jobs
- [ ] **Audit Logs**: Should display detailed audit trail
- [ ] **Data Export**: Should allow exporting history data
- [ ] **Search/Filter**: Should allow filtering by date, status, etc.

### 5. Settings Testing
- [ ] **Configuration Display**: Should show current system settings
- [ ] **Threshold Values**: Should display confidence and validation thresholds
- [ ] **System Actions**: Clear statistics, restart system should work
- [ ] **Regional Settings**: Should show supported regions

## üîß CLI Testing

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Test help
python main.py --help
python main.py process --help
python main.py web --help

# Test health check
python main.py health

# Test single file processing
python main.py process data/invoices/test1.txt

# Test batch processing
python main.py process data/invoices/*.txt --batch

# Test with different workflows
python main.py process test1.txt --workflow fast_track
python main.py process test1.txt --workflow detailed_review
```

### Expected CLI Outputs
- [ ] **Help Messages**: Should show clear usage instructions
- [ ] **Health Check**: Should report system status
- [ ] **Processing Output**: Should show step-by-step progress
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Should display meaningful error messages
- [ ] **Success Messages**: Should confirm successful operations

## üê≥ Docker Testing (Optional)

### Build and Run
```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t invoice-processor .

# Run with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# Check container health
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs app
```

### Container Tests

# Check service status
./scripts/status.sh
```

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
